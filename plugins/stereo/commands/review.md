Run a Codex review through the shared built-in reviewer.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Before any repository inspection or execution, inspect the raw arguments for `--model`. If its
value starts with `claude:`, stop with:
"`/stereo:review` is Codex-native and does not accept Claude models. Use
`/stereo:adversarial-review --model <claude selection>` for a Claude review."
A Codex `--model` value may carry an optional `codex:` prefix, which the companion strips.

Core constraint:

- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Codex's output verbatim to the user.

Execution mode rules:

- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run the review in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run the companion CLI's detached review flow.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant working-tree status is empty or the explicit branch diff is empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once with two options, putting the recommended option first and suffixing its label with `(Recommended)`:
  - `Wait for results`
  - `Run in background`

Argument handling:

- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not add extra review instructions or rewrite the user's intent.
- The companion CLI itself detaches the run when `--background` is passed.
- `/stereo:review` is native-review only. It does not support staged-only review, unstaged-only review, or extra focus text.
- If the user needs custom review instructions or more adversarial framing, they should use `/stereo:adversarial-review`.

Foreground flow:

- Run:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.ts" review "$ARGUMENTS"
```

- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.

Background flow:

- Run this foreground Bash call; the companion CLI detaches the durable job itself:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.ts" review "$ARGUMENTS --background"
```

- Relay the returned `jobId` and tell the user to run `/stereo:status <jobId>` for progress.
- Do not wait for the detached review to complete in this turn.
